1.Connect to Your Server:
    Open MobaXterm.
    Click Session in the top-left corner.
    In the Remote host field, enter your server's IP address.
    Ensure the port is 22 (the default SSH port).
    Enter your username (usually root).
    Click OK and enter your password when prompted (paste with Ctrl+V or right-click).
2.Initial Server Setup:
    After your first login, reboot the server by typing: reboot
    Wait a minute, then reconnect using your SSH client.
    The system may prompt you to upgrade. If so, run: do-release-upgrade
    Confirm all prompts with y or by pressing Enter. This process can take up to 30 minutes.
3.Harden SSH Access:
    Change the default SSH port to enhance security. Run: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    Find the line # Port 22. Remove the # and change 22 to a non-standard port (e.g., Port 2222). Warning: Avoid very common ports.
    Save the file (Ctrl+O), then exit nano (Ctrl+X).
    Restart the SSH service: sudo systemctl restart sshd
    Crucial: Close your current session and open a new one in MobaXterm, this time specifying your new SSH port (e.g., 2222) in the port field. Do not close your old session until you confirm the new one works.
4.Configure the Firewall (UFW):
    Enable the firewall and allow your new SSH port: sudo ufw enable && sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp (Replace 2222 with your chosen port).
    Verify the new connection works before closing the original session.
5.Disable ICMP (Ping) Responses:
    To improve stealth, configure the firewall to ignore ping requests: sudo nano /etc/ufw/before.rules
    Find the sections # ok icmp codes for INPUT and # ok icmp code for FORWARD.
    Within these blocks, change all ACCEPT policies for ICMP to DROP.
    Save and exit the file.
    Reload the firewall: sudo ufw disable && sudo ufw enable
    Test: Open Command Prompt on your Windows PC and run ping your-server-ip. It should show "Request timed out."
6.Install the 3x-ui Panel:
    Find the latest installation command on the official GitHub page: https://github.com/MHSanaei/3x-ui
    As of 2025-11-02, the command is:
    bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhsanaei/3x-ui/master/install.sh)
    If you see (venv) in your command prompt, run deactivate first.
    Execute the installation script. It will ask for a port for the panel—choose one (e.g., 2053).
    Upon completion, the terminal will display a green box with your login credentials (URL, username, password). Save this information securely.
7.Access the 3x-ui Panel:
    Allow the panel's port through the firewall: sudo ufw allow 2053/tcp
    Open your web browser and go to http://your-server-ip:2053. Log in with the credentials from the previous step.
8.Create a Reality Inbound:
    In the 3x-ui panel, go to Inbounds and click Add Inbound.
    Remark: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "My-Reality-Config").
    Protocol: Select vless.
    Client Flow: Choose xtls-rprx-vision.
    Port: Set a custom port (e.g., 1234). Remember to allow it in the firewall later (ufw allow 1234/tcp).
    Reality Settings: Under Dest, you can change the default site (e.g., yahoo.com) to another like google.com or mozilla.org. Click Get New Cert.
    Click Create.
    Reload Firewall: Run sudo ufw disable && sudo ufw enable to apply the new port rule.
9.Client Configuration (NekoRay / NekoBox):
    PC: Download NekoRay, unzip it, and run the executable as Administrator. Select sing-box as the core.
    Phone: Download NekoBox from your app store.
    In the 3x-ui panel, find your newly created inbound and copy the configuration link.
    In NekoRay, go to Profile -> Add profile from clipboard.
    Right-click on the new profile and select Start.
    Finally, set the global mode to TUN Mode (usually in the top-right corner).
This instruction is incomplete, it's a regular home VPN.
